# Google Material Design Icons

The icons in this folder were sourced from Google Material. These can be used if you are unable to get them directly from Google.

## Icons

A list of all the icons and the different styles can be found on the [Google Fonts documentation](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons)

## Sources

These files were obtained via the [developer portal for Material Icons](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/material_icons).

Below are the locations the files were obtained. The css files point to the specific .woff2 files for those icons. You can use the .woff2 files in this folder by using the corresponding css in your project, with the url pointing to our files instead of `fonts.gstatic.com`: (i.e. `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@laserfiche/lf-resource-library@2/resources/fonts/google_material_icons_regular.woff2`)
